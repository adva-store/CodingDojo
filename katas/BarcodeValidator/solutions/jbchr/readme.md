# Janek's Barcode validator

I used Python with for this project as I had to choose one unfamiliar programming language and it seemed easy to setup.

## Installation

You need to have installed python (v3) and pip to run the project.

Then install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the validator

```
python3 src/barcode_validator.py 28170280
```

## Run tests

```
python3 -m unittest tests/test_barcode_validator.py
```

or in watch mode:

```
