# Fizz Buzz Readme

the implementation should be seen as additional work which was not fully done as specified in the task. e.g not developt test driven.
I added it just for fun because I am fastinated by prolog since university, but had no possibility use this language.
Besides knowing the manin ideas and concepts I had to relearn everything I had to use.

Additionally I also had prepared an Erlang solution. but because it was (syntactically) similar to the prolog one and did not
require any Erlang specific technics (e.g. sending messages between different processes) I decided to not include it.

### Usage
Start the script on the comand line using `./fizz-buzz.pl` and use `fizBuzz(100)` to ask for the fizz-buzz-list from 1 to 100. The list is returned in reversed order.

## Requrements
This Kata requires SWI Prolog https://www.swi-prolog.org/ with the binary swipl to be installed in /usr/bin. (Linux default).
