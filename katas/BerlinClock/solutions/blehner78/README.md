# Berlin Clock draft
One try of solving the Berlin Clock with some HTML/CSS/Javascript. I have 
decided to keep it as simple as possible by getting the current time 
through the window object. 

## Dependencies
jquery
 
## Demo
index.html

## Features
Hide the info box by uncommenting the display: none line within the 
css/styles.css file
